Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Barbie,

I am writing to you from a flying saucer spaceship in a spiral galaxy. I found myself here one day after going for a ride on a purple rocket in June. There are Eight Aliens and Tortillas of Wolf here!
In the Operation theatre there is a pool full of water. I fall asleep each night on a beautiful bed of wood and dream of singing slowly. It feels as though I have lived here for
420 galactic years. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is drowning on a tripping tricycle!!

Best wishes,
Oppenheimer
